/**
 *
 * The Factory Method is a creational design pattern which uses factory methods to deal with the
 * problem of creating objects without specifying the exact class of object that will be created.
 * This is done by creating objects via calling a factory method either specified in an interface
 * and implemented by child classes, or implemented in a base class and optionally overridden by
 * derived classesâ€”rather than by calling a constructor.
 * In this Factory Method example we have an interface ([Blacksmith]) with a method for
 * creating objects ([Blacksmith.manufactureWeapon]). The concrete subclasses (
 * [OrcBlacksmith], [ElfBlacksmith]) then override the method to produce objects of
 * their liking.
